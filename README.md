## Summary

We are trying to develop web-based application called Vocabuddy specifically designed for learners preparing for standard tests such as ACT, SAT, and GRE. The design is focused on mastering the extensive vocabulary required for the exam. This application offers a streamlined, browser-accessible approach to vocabulary learning, removing the need for cumbersome app downloads. On top of providing dictionary like services, Vocabuddy encourages users to personalize their study plans with test-specific goals, prompting a series of interactive exercises, quizzes, and learning tools designed to master the exam's challenging vocabulary section.

Vocabuddy includes features for tracking vocabulary progress in real-time, which will allow learners to have a visual understanding of their mastery of words. Furthermore, Vocabuddy encourages a collaborative study environment, where users can connect, share progress, and challenge each other on GRE vocabulary quizzes. By leveraging search algorithms, the platform also offers personalized vocabulary recommendations based on study history and other parameters, ensuring learners are focusing on the most relevant and important words for the test. The ultimate goal is to make the verbal preparation of GRE tobe engaging, manageable, and effective.
